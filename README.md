# COVID-ML-Project
 
## Task 1:  
Build a Multiple Linear Regression model that predicts the number of deaths in various countries due to COVID-19. You are free to select and choose the dataset you would like to use while building the model and are allowed to use the Pandas Library in your code and can use Excel. The following technical/tool constraint applies: you are NOT allowed to use any existing machine learning packages, such as scikit-learn.

As a general guide, you may need to undertake the following actions:
- Find data sets for the number of deaths in various countries (a minimum of 20 countries) due to COVID-19.
- Research for appropriate predictor variables to predict deaths due to COVID-19.
- You may use time as one of the predictors (in which case you could attempt to predict death rates in the future), or you may choose to leave it out (in which case, you would be looking at the deaths at a fixed chosen point in time).
- Find data sets on the chosen predictors for the various countries in the model.
- Use plots to visualize and understand your data.
- Build a model and test the accuracy of your model, using an appropriately chosen metric (hint: r2 is not a good metric for this task).
- If needed, improve your model by incorporating other predictors, and/or removing existing ones.
- Discuss your data sets, model, accuracy, and what metrics you used to judge the accuracy.

## Task 2:  
You are free to find and define a problem of your interest related to COVID-19. The problem can be modelled either using Linear Regression (or Multiple Linear Regression) or Logistic Regression, which means you can work with either continuous numerical data or classification. The following technical/tool constraint applies: you are NOT allowed to use Neural Networks or other Machine Learning models. You must use Python and Jupyter Notebook.

In general, you may want to consider performing the following steps:
- Find an interesting problem which you want to solve either using Linear Regression or Classification. 
- Find a dataset to build your model. For example, you can use Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find suitable datasets.
- Use plots to visualize and understand your data.
- Create training and test data sets.
